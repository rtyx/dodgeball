Dodgeball

Kids are playing a game called Dodgeball. The game is played on a large playing field, each player standing in a different spot with integer coordinates.
The game starts with one player receiving a ball from one of the main eight compass directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW (listed in clockwise order).
Whenever a player gets the ball, he or she rotates clockwise in multiples of 45 degrees (starting with the next direction from which he or she has just received the ball), until they find another player standing in that exact direction. The player then throws the ball and leaves the field. If there are multiple players in the same direction, the ball always goes to the nearest one. Next player continues with this process and so the game goes on, until the player that received the ball doesn't have anybody else to throw the ball to.
The picture below shows how the game could go for similar starting positions of players but different starting players and directions.
